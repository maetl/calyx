module Calyx
  # The main public interface to Calyx. Grammars represent the concept of a
  # template grammar defined by a set of production rules that can be chained
  # and nested from a given starting rule.
  #
  # Calyx works like a traditional phrase-structured grammar in reverse. Instead
  # of recognising strings based on a union of possible matches, it generates
  # strings by representing the union as a choice and randomly picking one
  # of the options each time the grammar runs.
